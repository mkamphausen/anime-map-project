      <h3>Anime Tourism</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Anime tourism is the act of visiting any location associated with anime or manga. Restaurants, cafés, exhibits, events, museums, real-world venues, and so on.</li>
        <li>Anime Pilgrimage, also known as Anime Seichi Junrei in Japanese, is the act of visiting genuine anime locations that have been portrayed in an anime or manga.</li>
        <li>For example, if you've seen the film Kimi no Na wa (Your Name), you'll know that the steps where Mitsuha and Taki first meet are a real-life place. They can be found in Yotsuya, Tokyo.</li>
        <li>In this case, visiting the steps shown in the film Your name is Anime Pilgrimage, often known as Anime Seichi Junrei.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>アニメ (anime)</h4>
      <h4>聖地 (seichi) : sacred places</h4>
      <h4>巡礼 (junrei) : pilgrimage</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Anime pilgrimage is a subset of anime tourism, which is a broad phrase.</li>
        <li>It's the same as stating Algebra and Mathematics are the same thing. While algebra is a component of mathematics, it is not the same thing</li>
        <li>Walking to the Pokemon Cafe, viewing Captain Tsubasa sculptures, or visiting any other anime or manga related location is an example of Anime Tourism.</li>
        <li>On the other hand, Anime Pilgrimage exclusively visits real-life locations that have been featured in any anime.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>What is butaitanbou or Scene Hunter? Anime pilgrimage vs. butaitanbou?</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>There is a third word for visiting anime-related locations. In Japanese, it is known as scene hunter or butaitanbou.</li>
        <li>Scene Hunter, or Butaitanbou(舞台探訪), is the act of hunting or looking for scenes from animated shows.</li>
        <li>The literal translation is "finding and visiting the stage."</li>
        <li>In anime pilgrimage, you already know the precise location of the area depicted in the anime.</li>
        <li>You don't know where it is with the butaitanbou. As a result, you must identify the locations only based on the anime's sequences.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>When did the Anime Pilgrimage term originate?</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>According to Takeshi Okamoto's essay, the phrase "Anime Pilgrimage" dates back to the 1990s, when Sailor Moon fans began visiting the temples depicted in the anime.</li>
        <li>"Taking all of this data into account, one can infer that unambiguous examples of anime pilgrimage existed by the early 1990s, even if the word 'anime pilgrimage' was not generally used at the time." However, the phrase was used in otaku circles long before the mainstream media began using it more often around 2008." - Takeshi Okamoto</li>
        <li>However, it wasn't until 2016 that the name gained traction.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Can I only make Anime Pilgrimages in Japan?</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Japan has by far the most authentic anime locations</li>
        <li>Outside of Japan, however, there are other pilgrimage locations.</li>
        <li>There are other anime set both inside and outside of Japan.</li>
        <li>For example, Detective Conan is sometimes set in Europe.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Which websites write about Anime Tourism and Anime Pilgrimage?</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>The majority of anime pilgrimage sites are in Japanese, and the material is disorganized.</li>
        <li>There is no website that compiles information and destinations for anime tourism in one place. It's no accident that this is one of the key issues we want to address.</li>
      </ul>
